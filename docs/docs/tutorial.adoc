*This document is a work in progress!*

== Prerequisites

* Ren'Py
* A code editor (link:https://code.visualstudio.com/[VSCode] with the
link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LuqueDaniel.languague-renpy[Ren'Py Plugin]
is recommended)

== Walkthrough

=== 1. Project Preparation

. Create a new project directory under your Ren'Py workspace directory titled
  "CharacterCreatorTutorial" (or whatever you would like to call it).
. Download the link:https://github.com/Foxcapades/renpy-sprite-customizer/releases/latest[latest release] of the
  Sprite Customizer (specifically the 'base-project' zip file). and unzip it
  into your new project directory.
. In the new project directory, delete the `game/images/ccp` directory and its
  contents.
. Create a new directory under `game/images` called "sugar".
. Download link:https://github.com/Foxcapades/renpy-sprite-customizer/raw/main/docs/assets/sugar-life.zip[the tutorial asset pack]footnote:[Sprites from link:https://butterymilk.itch.io/sugary-life[the Sugary Life asset pack]] and unzip it into the `game/images/sugar` directory.
.. Your `game/images/sugar` directory should now contain multiple subdirectories
   named "accessories", "brows", "clothes", etc...
.. Explore the directories to familiarize yourself with the assets we will be
   using in this tutorial.

=== 2. The First Steps

==== Prep

. Open up your tutorial project directory in your code editor.
. Open the `game/sprite_customizer/config.rpy` file.
. Delete all the file's contents, leaving it empty.
. Add a new `define` statement for our {custom-sprite}, it's best to go ahead
  and make the declaration multi-line as we are going to be adding a lot to it.
+
[source%nowrap, python]
----
define player_customizer = CustomizedSprite(
)
----
.. Give it a name that we can use in our `show` statements.  We are going to
name it `player_base` for reasons we will explore <<char-expressions,later>>.
+
[source%nowrap, python]
----
define player_customizer = CustomizedSprite(
  "player_base",
)
----

==== Adding Our First Layer!

Now we are going to add our first layer to the {custom-sprite}.  Layers are
declared by creating new {sc-layer} instances and passing in a set of values
that tell it what options it has and how to render them.

Since layers are stacked on top of each other, the first layer is generally
going to be the base or skin layer.  In our case we have multiple customization
options for the skin layer, so this will be one of the more complex examples.

The full snippet is as follows, but we will break down what it means below.

[source%nowrap, python]
----
init python:
    def skin_lcb(skin_base, skin_color, **kwargs): <1>
        return Transform(f"images/sugar/skin/{skin_base}.png", matrixcolor=TintMatrix(skin_color))

define player_customizer = CustomizedSprite(
    "player_base",
    SCLayer( <2>
        "skin", <3>
        skin_lcb, <4>
        skin_base=SCOpt("Skin Base", group="Body", values=[ "dark", "medium", "light" ]), <5>
        skin_color=SCOpt("Skin Color", group="Body", values=[ <6>
            "#513021",
            "#874c2c",
            "#803716",
            "#b66837",
            "#a96238",
            "#f9bf91",
            "#ecc19f",
            "#9e9a73",
        ])
    )
)
----
<1> <<skin-lcb>> is used to generate the {displayable-docs} that will be used as
    the base layer for our customized sprite.
<2> {sc-layer} constructor call.
<3> Name of the layer.
<4> Reference to our `skin_lcb` callback, passing the callback to the new layer.
<5> Skin base option, directly relates to the skin base image files included in
    the tutorial sprite pack ("dark.png", "medium.png", "light.png").
<6> Skin color option.  A collection of hex codes that will be used to make a
    TintMatrix to apply the skin color to our grayscale base images.

[#skin-lcb]
===== The `skin_lcb` Callback

[source%nowrap, python]
----
def skin_lcb(skin_base, skin_color, **kwargs):
    return Transform(f"images/sugar/skin/{skin_base}.png", matrixcolor=TintMatrix(skin_color))
----

The `skin_lcb` function is a {lcb-docs} that is used to build the
{displayable-docs} that will be used as the base layer for our
{custom-sprite} instance.

This function takes our two option values ("skin_base" and "skin_color") and
uses them to provide a path to the target file and apply a TintMatrix to that
target file.

We pass this function to the created {sc-layer} instance to tell the layer how
to render that part of the customized sprite.

[#first-sc-layer]
===== Our First SCLayer

Our first {sc-layer} instance is constructed with the following arguments:

. The layer name
. A callback that will be used to generate our layer image
. An option group named `skin_base`
. An option group named `skin_color`

The layer name should be unique across all the layers in a single
{custom-sprite} instance.

The callback is described above in <<skin-lcb>>.

The first option group, `skin_base`, is a list of the distinct portion of the
paths to the target image files.  In our case, the paths are all the same except
for the file name (minus the extension) which is one of "dark", "medium", or
"light".

The second option group, `skin_color`, is a list of hex color codes that will be
used to apply a {tint-matrix} to the selected grayscale base image.

=== 3. Showing Our Image

Now we have a base sprite (even if it's just a skin layer), lets show it so we
can watch our progress in-game via script reloads.

. Open `game/script.rpy` and delete all its contents.
. Create a new <<sc-state>> object to hold our custom sprite option selections.
+
[source%nowrap, python]
----
default customizer_state = SCState()
----
. Add an link:https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/label.html#special-labels[`after_load`]
  label and a python line to load our
  link:https://foxcapades.github.io/renpy-sprite-customizer/#_sprite_state[state]
  into the sprite customizer on game load time (without this the option
  selections will not show when loading a game).
+
[source%nowrap, python]
----
label after_load:
    $ player_customizer.set_state(customizer_state)
----
+
. Add our `start` label and another python line to load our
  link:https://foxcapades.github.io/renpy-sprite-customizer/#_sprite_state[state]
  into the sprite customizer.  This is done so that the player's choices will be
  stored as part of the game save files.
+
[source%nowrap, python]
----
label start:
    $ player_customizer.set_state(customizer_state)
----
. Show our customized sprite.
+
[source%nowrap, python]
----
label start:
    $ player_customizer.set_state(customizer_state)
    show player_base <1>
----
<1> "player_base" is the name we gave our {custom-sprite} instance in
    `config.rpy`
. Add a `pause` so the game doesn't end immediately.
+
[source%nowrap, python]
----
label start:
    $ player_customizer.set_state(customizer_state)
    show player_base
    pause 1000000
----

Now we can reload our game as we add layers and see our changes live!

image::../assets/images/tutorial/tutorial-01.png[]

=== 4. Adding More Layers

Now that we can see what we are doing, let's go back to `config.rpy` and add
more layers.

==== 4.1 Clothes

Next we will add the clothes layer, this layer is a simple image swap layer so
the definition of it will be more simple than the skin layer.

. In the {custom-sprite} declaration, add a new argument that is another
{sc-layer} constructor:
+
[source%nowrap, python]
----
define player_customizer = CustomizedSprite(
    "player_base",
    SCLayer(
        ...
    ),
    SCLayer(
        "clothes",
        "images/sugar/clothes/{clothes}.png", <1>
        clothes=SCOpt("Clothes", group="Body", values=[ "tshirt", "tie", "bow" ])
    ),
)
----
<1> For this layer, since we will just be swapping images out without any
    transforms, we can pass a template path instead of a callback.
. Go ahead and reload the game now and you should see the `tshirt` layer
  rendering on top of the base image.
+
image::../assets/images/tutorial/tutorial-02.png[]

==== 4.2 Hair

Now we will stack the hair layer onto our sprite.  This layer is another one
with multiple images as well as color options, so we will be declaring another
callback.

Under our existing `skin_lcb` callback in the `init python` block we will add
a new function named `hair_lcb` which does the same thing the `skin_lcb`
function does but with a different image path.

[source%nowrap, python]
----
init python:
    def skin_lcb(skin_base, skin_color, **kwargs):
        return Transform(f"images/sugar/skin/{skin_base}.png", matrixcolor=TintMatrix(skin_color))

    def hair_lcb(hair_style, hair_color, **kwargs):
        return Transform(f"images/sugar/hair/hair{hair_style}.png", matrixcolor=TintMatrix(hair_color))
----

Lets look at this callback quickly.  As it takes the arguments `hair_style` and
`hair_color` which means our new layer must have those options attached to it.

Now that that's out of the way, lets add our hair layer.

[source%nowrap, python]
----
define player_customizer = CustomizedSprite(
    "player_base",
    ...
    SCLayer(
        "hair",
        hair_lcb,
        hair_style=SCOpt("Style", group="Hair", values=[ 1, 2, 3 ]), <1>
        hair_color=SCOpt("Color", group="Hair", values=[ <2>
            "#3D2314",
            "#100C07",
            "#DA680F",
            "#FFCC47",
            "#9A9E9F",
            "#FAFAFA",
            "#801818",
            "#580271",
            "#1592CA",
            "#11694E",
            "#FF87C5"
        ])
    ),
)
----
<1> The first option just has the values `1`, `2`, and `3` as that is the only
    part of the image name that differs between hair style images.
<2> The second option is a selection of hex codes for hair color options we will
    allow.

==== 4.3 Eyes

The eyes layer is another simple layer without a transform, so we can construct
our {sc-layer} instance an image path rather than a callback.

[source%nowrap, python]
----
define player_customizer = CustomizedSprite(
    "player_base",
    ...
    SCLayer(
        "eyes",
        "images/sugar/eyes/{eye_color}.png",
        eye_color=SCOpt("Eyes", group="Face", values=[ "blue", "green", "grey", "yellow" ])
    ),
)
----

image::../assets/images/tutorial/tutorial-04.png[]


==== 4.4 Accesories

Our sprite pack comes with glasses and a bow, so we may as well add layers for
those too.

This is a good chance to talk about _removing_ options.  Right now, there is no
way to do this via the Sprite Customizer other than using a blank PNG file which
is what we will do to "remove" the accessory layers.

The glasses layer is a simple image path layer, while the bow layer has color
options like the skin and hair.

[source%nowrap, python]
----
init python:
    ...
    def hair_accessory_lcb(hair_accessory, hair_accessory_color, **kwargs):
        return Transform(f"images/sugar/accessories/{hair_accessory}.png", matrixcolor=TintMatrix(hair_accessory_color))

define player_customizer = CustomizedSprite(
    "player_base",
    ...
    SCLayer(
        "eyes",
        "images/sugar/accessories/{face_accessory}.png",
        face_accessory=SCOpt("Glasses", group="Face", values=[ "glasses", "none" ])
    ),
    SCLayer(
        "hair_accessory",
        hair_accessory_lcb,
        hair_accessory=SCOpt("Bow", group="Hair", values=[ "bow", "none" ]),
        hair_accessory_color=SCOpt("Bow Color", group="Hair", values=[
            "#849FF7",
            "#A583F7",
            "#FFEB79",
            "#FFD579"
        ])
    ),
)
----

image::../assets/images/tutorial/tutorial-05.png[]


=== 5. The Character Customization Screen

Now we have added all our base options (the remaining options will be used in
a `layeredimage` for mood), lets show the included character customization
screen and play with what we've made so far.

To do this, go back to the `script.rpy` file and add call the customization
screen.

.`script.rpy`
[source%nowrap, python]
----
default customizer_state = SCState()

label start:
    $ player_customizer.set_state(customizer_state)
    show player_base
    pause 1000000

    $ quick_menu = False <1>
    call screen sprite_creator("player_base", player_customizer) <2>
    $ quick_menu = True <3>

    pause 1000000
----
<1> Hide the quick menu as it looks out of place with the `sprite_creator`
    screen open.
<2> Call the `sprite_creator` screen passing in the name of our player image
    as well as a reference to the {custom-sprite} instance itself.
<3> Reshow the quick menu when we leave the character customization screen.

Play around with what you've made!

[#char-expressions]
=== 6. Character Expressions

Now that we have a base for character, we can make the
link:https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/layeredimage.html[Layered Images] necesesary
to have character expressions.  We won't go into too much detail here as this is
a standard Ren'Py feature.

. Open up the `game/images.rpy` file and delete all of its contents.
. Create a new `layeredimage` named "player".
+
[source%nowrap, python]
----
layeredimage player:
----
. Add an `always` attribute to show our customized sprite, `player_base`.
+
[source%nowrap, python]
----
layeredimage player:
    always:
        "player_base"
----
. Add a new group named "eyebrows" for our eyebrow expression sprites, "angry"
  "neutral", "questioning", "raised", and "sad" and add those sprite paths.
+
[source%nowrap, python]
----
layeredimage player:
    always:
        "player_base"

    group eyebrows:
        attribute angry_brows:
            "images/sugar/brows/angry.png"
        attribute neutral_brows default:
            "images/sugar/brows/neutral.png"
        attribute questioning_brows:
            "images/sugar/brows/questioning.png"
        attribute raised_brows:
            "images/sugar/brows/raised.png"
        attribute sad_brows:
            "images/sugar/brows/sad.png"
----
. Add another group named "mouth" for our mouth expression sprites, "frown",
  "happy", "smile", and "surprised".
+
[source%nowrap, python]
----
layeredimage player:
    ...
    group mouth:
        attribute frown:
            "images/sugar/mouth/frown.png"
        attribute happy:
            "images/sugar/mouth/happy.png"
        attribute smile default:
            "images/sugar/mouth/smile.png"
        attribute surprised:
            "images/sugar/mouth/surprised.png"
----


Now we have constructed a layered image with expressions that we can use as our
character sprite.  To do this we need to go back to `script.rpy` and edit the
references to `player_base` to say "player" instead.  This will use our new
layered image rather than the raw custom sprite it's based on.

[source%nowrap, python]
----
default customizer_state = SCState()

label start:
    $ player_customizer.set_state(customizer_state)
    show player
    pause 1000000

    $ quick_menu = False
    call screen sprite_creator("player", player_customizer)
    $ quick_menu = True

    pause 1000000
----

image::../assets/images/tutorial/tutorial-07.png[]


Now we can change our player character sprites expression by using our
`layeredimage`'s attributes like so:

[source%nowrap, python]
----
    show player raised_brows surprised
    # or
    show player angry_brows frown
    # etc...
----
