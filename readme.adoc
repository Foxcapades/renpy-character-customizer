A pluggable sprite customization framework that allows the creation of any
number of playtime-customizable sprites using Ren'Py's
link:{renpy-docs}/layeredimage.html[LayeredImage]s.

The goal of this project is to allow game creators to plug in their own assets
and screens to set up character or sprite customization in their own games.

[IMPORTANT]
--
Presently this framework is only compatible with Ren'Py 8+ and Python 3.

[NOTE]
--
The included character customization screen is for demonstration purposes only.
It is recommended that users of this framework build their own customization
screens using the API demonstrated by the demo screens.

== Project Layout

=== link:game/sprite_customizer[The `sprite_customizer` Directory]

The `game/sprite_customizer` directory is where the source and configuration for
the Sprite Customizer lives.

This directory contains 2 files and a subdirectory:

* `src/`
* `config.rpy`
* `gui.rpy`

==== The `src` Directory

The source directory contains the source files for the classes that back the
Sprite Customizer.

This is where you would go if you want to hack the behavior of the Sprite
Customizer.

==== `screens.rpy`

The `screens.rpy` file is where the demo Sprite Customizer screen is defined.

This is where you go if you want to redefine or alter the Sprite Customization
screen.


=== link:game/customized_sprites.rpy[`customized_sprites.rpy`]

The `customized_sprites.rpy` file is where the demo sprites are defined.  This
file is intended to be used to hold your Customized Sprite configuration(s) and
layer callbacks.


=== link:game/images.rpy[`images.rpy`]

The `images.rpy` file contains the declaration of "normal" Ren'Py images for use
in the script.

This file contains a demonstration of using the customized character sprites as
part of link:{renpy-docs}/layeredimage.html[LayeredImage]s.

=== link:game/script.rpy[`script.rpy`]

The `script.rpy` file contains a basic example usage of the Sprite Customizer
and provides a template from which you can model your own usage of the toolset.
