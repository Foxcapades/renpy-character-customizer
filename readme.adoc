= Ren'Py Character Customizer

A pluggable character sprite customization framework that allows the creation of
any number of customized and runtime customizable sprites using Ren'Py's
``LayeredImage``s.

This project is currently in its early stages so, while it works fine, the
included ``screen``s are not the prettiest.  Luckily this framework provides the
tools necessary to customize those ``screen``s.
