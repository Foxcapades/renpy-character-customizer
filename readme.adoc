A pluggable sprite customization framework that allows the creation of any
number of playtime-customizable sprites using Ren'Py's
link:{renpy-docs}/layeredimage.html[LayeredImage]s.

The goal of this project is to allow game creators to plug in their own assets
and screens to set up character or sprite customization in their own games.

This project is currently in its early stages so, while it works fine, the
included ``screen``s are not the prettiest.  Luckily this framework provides
tools to assist in customizing those ``screen``s.

== Project Layout

=== link:game/ccf[The `ccf` Directory]

The code necessary to run the sprite customizer lives under the `ccf` directory
and is broken into 3 files:

link:game/ccf/ccf_config.rpy[ccf_config.rpy]::

`ccf_config.rpy` is where the configuration for the
link:https://foxcapades.github.io/renpy-sprite-customizer/#custom-sprite[CustomizedSprite]s
lives.  This file is where the sprite files are referencedand the options
provided to build the CustomizedSprite instances.
+
This is where you go to configure your sprite customization.

link:game/ccf/ccf_gui.rpy[ccf_gui.rpy]::

`ccf_gui.rpy` is where the sprite customization screen and components are
defined.
+
This is where you go to change the sprite customization screen.

link:game/ccf/ccf_src.rpy[ccf_src.rpy]::

`ccf_src.rpy` is where the core of the Sprite Customizer is defined.
+
This is where you go if you want to hack the source and customize its behavior.

=== link:game/images.rpy[`images.rpy`]

The `images.rpy` file contains the declaration of "normal" Ren'Py images for use
in the script.

This file contains a demonstration of using the customized character sprites as
part of link:{renpy-docs}/layeredimage.html[LayeredImage]s.

=== link:game/script.rpy[`script.rpy`]

The `script.rpy` file contains a basic example usage of the Sprite Customizer
and provides a template from which you can model your own usage of the toolset.
