= Ren'Py Character Customizer

A pluggable character sprite customization framework that allows the creation of
any number of playtime-customizable sprites using Ren'Py's ``LayeredImage``s.

This project is currently in its early stages so, while it works fine, the
included ``screen``s are not the prettiest.  Luckily this framework provides the
tools necessary to customize those ``screen``s.

=== The `ccf` Directory

The code necessary to run the character customizer lives under the
link:game/ccf[ccf] directory and is broken into 3 files:

link:game/ccf/ccf_config.rpy[ccf_config.rpy]::

`ccf_config.rpy` is where the configuration of the ``CharacterCustomizer``s
lives.  This file is where the sprite files are referenced and the options
provided to build the `CharacterCustomizer` instances.
+
This is where you go to configure your character customization.

link:game/ccf/ccf_gui.rpy[ccf_gui.rpy]::

`ccf_gui.rpy` is where the character customization screen and components are
defined.
+
This is where you go to customize the Character Customization screen.

link:game/ccf/ccf_src.rpy[ccf_src.rpy]::

`ccf_src.rpy` is where the core of the Character Customizer is defined.
+
This is where you go if you want to hack the source and customize its behavior.

=== link:game/script.rpy[`script.rpy`]

The `script.rpy` file contains a basic example usage of the Character Customizer
and provides a template from which you can model your own usage of the toolset.
