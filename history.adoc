= Version History

== Version 2.x.x

=== v2.0.0

==== Features

* Color option and picker
* Sprite customization screen may now be customized via the
`lib/fxcpds/sprite_customizer/customizer/config.rpy`.


==== Changes

* Major restructuring of the project layout.  SpriteCustomizer code now lives in
the `lib/fxcpds/sprite_customizer` directory.
* Options can no longer be constructed via tuples, direct constructor calls are
now required.
* Options are no longer passed to layers via keyword args, they are now passed
as a list of options.


==== Misc

What the heck does `fxcpds` mean?::
That is an abbreviation of Foxcapades, the creator's username

Why put things in this weird directory?::
Because Foxcapades intends to make multiple Ren'Py libraries, it was decided
that, to keep things clean and avoid conflicts, the libraries would be placed
under a directory that would not conflict with anything else.
+
For example, if there were a new library named "Foo Bar", it would live under
the `lib/fxcpds/foo_bar` directory.
